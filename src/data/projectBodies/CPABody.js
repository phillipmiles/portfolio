    <Paragraph>
      DeakinCo. worked with CPA to create an engaging new experience to help
      their accounting students take their technical capabilities and apply them
      more strategically for real world situations. As a designer/developer of a
      small team, I was heavily involved from UX and visual design through
      prototyping and development to final testing and bug fixing.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      What resulted was an online learning experience with a rich first-person
      narrative that propels students through full screen videos and interactive
      activities to end with a final breakdown of their performance. Extensive
      analytical data is captured for the client to review and adjust their
      curriculum as needed.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The success of the first module resulted in the client's investment in
      additional modules for other subjects in 2017 and again in 2018. The more refined subsequent modules
      would also go on to receive multiple industry awards in learning design.
