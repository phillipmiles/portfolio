      In 2019 I was brought into Verso Learning as the primary custodian of the
      web app's front-end and would become an important part in implementing an
      uplift for the entire app which was only then in early planning.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      As part of the uplift and supported by a fresh design system, I built out
      a rich, well documented component library of well over 100 highly reusable
      React components. This proved to be incredibly powerful with keeping up
      with the constant stream of new features to the ever evolving web app and
      as the development of a second app begun.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Some of the important new features involved finding ways to visualise data
      to the user. As such, I became intimately familiar with the amCharts
      library as I challenged myself to never limit the designer's vision.
