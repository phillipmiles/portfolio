      For Clear Ears, DeakinCo. was challenged with developing a completely
      bespoke learning portal as well as the learning content within it. Content
      was split between case studies, where users attempt to treat fictional
      patients with interactive activities, and topics, where users could review
      the knowledge needed for completing the case studies.

      For this project I ended up wearing multiple hats, jumping between
      preparing and editing visual assets, constructing many of the html
      templates and interactive activities and conducting testing and bug fixing
      for the site.
