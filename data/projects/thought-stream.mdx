I had been eyeing [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for a while when I first started on Thought Stream. As a app development framework that lets you create Apps for both Apple Iphone and Android using only Javascript and React, React Native was something I had been wanting to play around with for a while.

So when I had a personal need for a mobile app I jumped on it.

I frequently take notes throughout my day. Often not because I want to return to them but just because I want to get them out of my head.

In the past I had used paper. A lot of it. But I was tired of having piles of paper everywhere as well as being increasingly concious of the environment. So I wanted to switch to using a note taking app.

The problem was I wasn't happy with any of the apps I tried.

They either felt too bloated, weren't fast enough, took too many button presses or were just plain ugly. All I wanted was something as close to the simiplicity and speed of writing on a piece of paper.

### The app

On paper what I ended up making is not really desimilar to existing note taking apps. Regardless I actually liked using it. It gave me exactly what I wanted in just the way that I wanted it. Since this was an app intended just for myself it was perfect.

The core intention of the app was to serve as a dumping ground for thoughts on an infinite wall ordered by time. Notes are not meant to be deleted (although they can be) but instead simply accumulate forever with older notes dissapearing (but never gone) further up and up the scrollable wall. There is no other way to order notes as I found I almost never return to notes older then a couple of weeks.

Notes also didn't need to be tagged, labeled or searchable because the primary goal here is to simply get the thought out of my head. They can however be filtered as when I do return to my notes I frequently return with the objective of reviewing notes on a specifict subject rather then all recent notes regardless of topic.

This filtering is achieved through "Streams" (hence why the app is called 'Thought Stream'). Stream affectivly act as a category. When writing a note you can specify what stream to add it in but by default the app will add the note to the same stream of the previously added note. The reason behind this is because I would often have a string of thoughts in a row on the one subject and it saved on a button press to note have to specify the stream on every new note.

### Challenges

The biggest challenged was the rich text editor. React Native by itself doesn't come with one and because every primitive React Native component is written in the operating systems own language I couldn't excactly write my own without spending way too much time learning and developing it.

Another challenges were performance. Especially on page loads. Any delay would effectively kill any chance that I would actually use the app. This was largely solved by using recommended development practices and through careful and intentiounal priorities rendering of components at different times within a transition.

The final challenge was jank. At the end of the day React Native just won't ever be as good as an app writting in the operating systems native code. Within it there exists numerous little querks and inconsistances that would just feel a little off compared to a typical app. I had to expierment and discover work arounds to these issues to make sure the user experience didn't distract from the user's objective when using it.
