Towards the end of 2018 Coles was looking to roll out a new tool for use in training their deli's staff. The project called for a digital learning solution with a branching narrative that would fork down different paths based on the user's performance. The full scope was 5 separate E-Learns with over 100 screens of content.

This was not a simple task due to the constraints of the [Adapt Framework](https://www.adaptlearning.org/index.php/adapt-framework/), a JS framework for developing E-Learn modules for an LMS (Learning Management System), that was not designed to handle a branching learning experience.

Effectively the framework required an enormous amount of repeated data to make this possible. This created a development nightmare as chasing down bugs and applying change requests would have to be carefully applied in numerous places with many opportunities for errors.

Furthermore we needed to make a long term branching solution to offer to future clients and one that none developers in the team could build with.

To solve the issue of marking up that much content whilst keeping it easily maintainable we turned to an automated solution. We created a Node JS program that generated the necessary code from a series of spreadsheets as the data source. These could be edited by people with no programming experience. The programs output when then be consumed in the Adapt Framework's build script.

By the end of the project the program would generate over 54,000 lines of JSON code for the 5 required modules and left us with a reusable automation tool that would later be applied to future projects.
