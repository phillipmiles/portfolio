Towards the end of 2018 Coles was looking to roll out a new tool for use in their deli's. In order to upskill their staff, they came to DeakinCo. to help develop a digital learning solution. With Coles sold on a branching learning experience we were tasked with the unfortunate business of constructing five learning modules each with a branching progression that together would consist with over 100 screens of content.

To solve the issue of marking up that much content whilst keeping it easily maintainable we turned to an automated solution. We created a Node JS program to generate the mark-up code using spreadsheets as the source. By the end of the project the program would generate over 54,000 lines of JSON code for the 5 required modules and left us with a reusable automation tool that would later be applied to future projects.
