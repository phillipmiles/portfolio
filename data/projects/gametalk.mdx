GameTalk was my first attempt at a full-stack web development project.

It's a community website from gamers that is essentially a reddit clone. Users can post various media links and files to a specific game prompting a discussion with other users.

The similarities with reddit continue was the actual usage of an old algorithm used by reddit to order posts on the"hot/Trending" page.

The algorithm uses time since a post was created along with the number of the post's upvotes. The value returned is saved to the database and defines the post's position in the post orders.

The comment system also mimics reddit's nested commenting system.

Comments can be applied not only to posts but also other comments creating branching trees of comments.

The challenge with this project was enormous amount of new information I had to learn.

The web stack consisted of a PHP backend using the Laravel framework, a MySQL database and a pretty traditional frontend of HTML, CSS and Javascript and JQuery but assisted with Laravel's templating system.

Most of these technologies I had either never used before or only have a very basic level of exposure. Topics I had to get caught up on were PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Routing, Templating, APIs, User Authentication, Security concerns (password handling, SQL Injections), etc.
