In 2016 I was eager to flex my skills and challenge myself with new ones by trying at building a complete web app. So, I started a project that merged my interest of video games with my fondness for the community forum Reddit.

The result was a community website on video games that included functionality for user account creation, login/logout, posting of discussions and comments and a voting system for quality content. Some additional touches I took from Reddit was the algorithm used for sorting 'hot' or 'trending' posts as well as the nested tree style comment system.
