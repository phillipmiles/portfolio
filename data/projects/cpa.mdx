DeakinCo. worked with CPA to create an engaging new experience to help their accounting students take their technical capabilities and apply them more strategically for real world situations.

As a designer/developer of a small team, I was involved right from the start. I contributed to the UX brainstorming sessions, the creation of mockup designs in the [InvisionApp](https://www.invisionapp.com) and was the primary front-end developer for the project's development cycle.

What resulted was an online learning experience with a rich first-person narrative that propels students forwards through full screen videos and interactive activities ending with a final breakdown of their performance.

Additionally, extensive analytical data was captured from the student's interactions with the modules. This data was then provided to the client through a custom made dashboard.

The success of the first module resulted in the client's investment in additional modules for other subjects. The more refined subsequent modules would also go on to receive multiple industry awards in learning design.
