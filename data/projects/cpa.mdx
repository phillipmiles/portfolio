DeakinCo. worked with CPA to create an engaging new experience to help their accounting students take their technical capabilities and apply them more strategically for real world situations. As a designer/developer of a small team, I was heavily involved from UX and visual design through prototyping and development to final testing and bug fixing.

What resulted was an online learning experience with a rich first-person narrative that propels students through full screen videos and interactive activities to end with a final breakdown of their performance. Extensive analytical data is captured for the client to review and adjust their curriculum as needed.

The success of the first module resulted in the client's investment in additional modules for other subjects. The more refined subsequent modules would also go on to receive multiple industry awards in learning design.
