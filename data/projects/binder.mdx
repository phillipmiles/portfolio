As someone who enjoys the clarity gained from writing, I was constantly on the lookout for a writing tool that matched my own slightly unique preferences for working. At the same time, I was wanting to familiarise myself with some different JS libraries and further my understanding in databases and internet security. These motivating factors were enough to prompt me into developing my own writing web app.

With focus put on clarity, encapsulation, collaboration and speed, the app's foundation has been built with a hierarchical folder structure and real-time collaboration of text documents. Future development will further extend the collaboration features and introduce a streamlined and intelligent styling of text documents.
