My role in this project was to help migrate their front end website from a lergacy weordpress version to their more modern Gutenverg block based system which utilises the React framework.

Gutenberg operates with blocks that make up various parts of a web page. They should be configurable in a way that lets them be reusable across the website. In this way they are very siilar to a good React component.

The creation of these blocks was my job with ther actual construction of the web pages unsing these blocks left the the content editors on the team.

This meant thaty each block had two front ends that needed to be made. One to be displayed in the Wordpress page editor for the content editors to populate with content. The other wone would be for the actual front facing site that visiting users would see and interact with.

- Configuration
- Themse parent/child theme.JSON
- challenge
- - Took a bit to get up to speed with wordpresses way of Working
- - the lack of good documentation requring me to trawl therough wordpresses github pages to find the functions and components I needed
- - The mix of react vs old school. Ie - SASS and CSS, React and JS, HTML and JSX
- - strange design decisions
- - - gigantic theme file
- - - reliance on dynamic blocks so that edits to the blocks would populate across the site insetread of the opt in strategy.

One great benifit of transitioning to Gutenberg was a significant page render speed. The old website was incredably bloated with time to first render taking up to 5 to 6 seconds and time to full render up to 10 seconds which in website page speed terms is horrendous. This didn't matter if it was on a first time page load or a return visit. Caching seemed to have no effect. The initial server connection speed took over 2 seconds and it also appeared that the site was downloading the entire site regardless of whether it was relavent to the current page or not. Over 300 seperate network requests are made at page load.
