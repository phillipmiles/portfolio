Back in 2020 [Verso Learning](www.versolearning.com) was initiating a complete redesign of their web app using the React framework and was starting production on a second app.

The apps focus was in providing teachers and educators the tools and frameworks needed to improve their professional skills utilising user generated data from a merging of lesson plans, student feedback and student progression tracking.

As part of the project the development team saw the opportunity to conduct a rewrite of the frontend codebase which had become frankensteined by different developers over the years.

This was in a large part due to the lack of a designer guiding the app's visual style coupled with spontaneity of new requirements encountering a codebase that lacked any consistent coding practices.

I was brought in along with a designer to handle the implementation of the redesign. Working closely with the designer we created a design language that would direct developers and designers in their work going forwards.

The design language was then integrated into our chosen CSS in JS solution called [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) which allowed us to restrict styles to those defined in our design guide. This insured consistency across the web apps by creating a friction point for developers that would automatically guide them even without a designer present on the team.

A second friction point was created by separating the core components out into an isolated NPM module. Again to help deter any spontaneous changes that may erode the codebase. These components were then integrated in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which provided clear, easy to read documentation for the components and would dynamically update itself based on changes made to the component's code.

The result was a component library of over 100 new, versatile and documented components shared across two different web apps.

The core app relied heavily on user generated data that often needed to be communicated back to the user through interactive charts.

I used [AMCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/) to provide a number of default charts and the tools needed to create new chart types from scratch.

A problem we encountered with the charts was that of poor performance. Animations both within and from outside the charts would struggle to remain smooth as React would perform re-renders on large sections of the app.

Careful monitoring of performance using various tools helped me isolate problematic areas that caused large repaints of the webpage

This problem was solved by memoizing various page data in the problematic areas with the use of the memo function, the useMemo and useCallback react hooks and tracking down of incorrect dependency declarations in the useEffect hooks.

I left the project feeling proud of the work I had done and confident in the longevity of the systems we set up.
