Back in 2020 Verso was inititing a complete redesign of their web app using the React framework. As part of the redesign the development team saw the opportunity to conduct a rewrite of the frontend codebase which had become frankenstiened by different developers over the years.

This was in a large part due to the spontinaity of new requirements and an ever changing visual design unguided by a deadicated designer encountering a codebase that lacked any restrictions or documentation for developers on how changes should be made.

  width={680}
  aspectRatio="17/10"

I was brought in along with a designer and product manager to handle the implementation of the redesign. Working closely with the designer we created a design language that would hold up and direct new developers and designers in their work for years to come.

The design language was then integrated into our chosen CSS in JS solution called [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) restricting what styles could be applied to components. This insured consistancy accross the web app by creating a friction point for developers that would guide them even without a designer present on the team.

A second friction point was created by sperating the core components out into an isolated NPM module. Again to help deter any spontanious changes that may errode the codebase. These components were then integrated in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which served as a dynamically updated documentation and would force careful consideration to be made before getting changed by developers.

The result was a component library of over 100 new, versatile and documented components used across two web apps.

The app which guided teachers into improving their professional ability within the education space relyed heavily on user generated data and student feedback. This needed to be communicted to the user through interactive charts.

A problem we encountered with the charts was that poor performance was hurting numerous animations within the charts and other interactive elements. Careful monitoring of performace using various tools helped me isolate problamatic areas. The colpreate was always page data triggering component rerenders on components that didn't rerendering. On each component rerender the web browser would then have to repaint large section of the the page which took too many resources away from insuring butter smooth animations.

This problem was solved by memoizing various page data in the problamatic areas with the use of the useMemo and useCallback reat hooks.

All in all I left the project feeling proud of the work I had done and confident in the longevity of the systems we set up.
