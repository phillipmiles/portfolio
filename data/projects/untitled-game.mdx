Ever since I was a kid I have always wanted to create a video game. With the introduction of AI art generators I finally saw an opportunity to fulfil this childhood dream at a quality I would be satisfied with.

I have taken tentative steps towards this goal in the past going way back to when I was just 10 years old. Back then I would draw monsters, and gear with accompanies lore and stat sheets.

Later I advanced to creating mods and maps for games like Morrowind, Oblivion and Counter-Strike Global Offensive. I even volunteered as a concept artist at one point for someone else's project.

And in university I did a brief semester in a game development bachelor's degree at RMIT before switching into an Information Technology degree.

I had never seriously sat down to make a game from scratch but once my programming skills had improved from the years working as a developer and with the introduction of AI image generation effectively solving the art side I have finally begun.

The advancements in AI generating technologies introduced services like [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) and [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home) which could quickly create images in all manner of styles with simple text prompts.

This solved the bottleneck of time needed for creating art assets, an issue which had prevented me from starting in the past.

The workflow I use begins with an isometric image generated from MidJourney. From the resulting image I then isolate and extract specific elements out creating a kind of library of reusable scene parts, items and furniture. These are then spliced together and further altered with my own illustrations to create rich seamless backgrounds.

The game itself is an isometric slice-of-life game focusing on someone struggling with depression and anxiety who pursues woodworking as a means to re-establish connection within a community. As the player progresses in the narrative, the game world slowly transitions from a dark and moody environment into the warm, lush one pictured in the test images here.

I'm developing the game within the [Unreal Game Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) and use Unreal's Blueprints to program the game logic.

My focus is currently on establishing a firm art style and to develop some of the basic game systems.

A crucial system I've already developed is how the sprites are ordered allowing characters to move in front and behind objects in a 2D world where depth is largely faked.

This is accomplished by first casting rays around a character to detect overlapping sprites. The preset order of these static sprites dictate what Z position the character should be by the sprites ordering value and by the character's Y position relative to the sprites explicit 'ground connection' line which tell the game system where a sprite connects with the ground and where the character should be able to walk around.

Then a ray is cast along the Y axis to locate the overlapping sprite's ground connection line (yellow line). If the character is above this line it is ordered behind the sprite (right side), if it is below the line then it goes infront of the sprite. (left side)"
/>

Another system is how shadows on characters are handled. Because environmental shadows are backed into the illustrations there needs to be a way to cast a shadow on a character that enters those shaded areas.

For this I created shadow volumes. Characters cast more rays around them to locate any nearby shadow volumes. As the character approaches a shadow volume their sprite gets tinted based on the distance to the shadow volume. If the character is within the shadow volume 100% of the tint is applied.
