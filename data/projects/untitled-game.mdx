Ever since I was a kid I have always wanted to create a video game. With the introduction of AI art generators I finally saw an opportunity to realistically fullfill this childhood dream.

Early steps towards this goal included draw characters and creating stat sheets as a 10 year. I later advanced to creating mods and maps for the games Morrowind, Oblivion and Counter Strike Global Offensive. I even volenteered as a concept artist at one point for someone else project. Then finally I did a brief semester in a game development bachelor degree at RMIT university.

None of these were serious attempts at making a game but rather an exploration into the space. But after my programming skills improved from years working as a front-end developer it finally became realistic to make a game.

However due to the challenges I faced with the creation of art assets. Perfectionism, a personal skill level I was unsatisied with and simply not having the time to create 100s of assets were all too big of a challenge for me to cross.

But then advancements in AI generatoring technologies introduced services like [Stable Diffusioin](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) and [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home) which could quickly create images of all manner of styles with simple text prompts.

This effectively solved the problems I had with creating art assets.

The workflow I use is to create isometric art assets with a specific style in mind from within an AI generator. From the resulting image I isolate and extract various elements of the image that I like. These are then spliced together and further altered with my own illustrating to create rich seamless backgrounds and individual assets.

The game itself is an isometric slice-of-life game focusing on someone struggling with depression and anxiety who persues woodworking as a means to reestablish connection within a community. I'm developing the game within the [Unreal Game Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) and uses Unreal's Blueprints as the method I use to program the game logic.
