[Woodfort Cases](https://www.woodfortcases.com) is a small business I started that sells handmade wood panelled PC cases.

Somewhere during the pandemic I needed to take a step back from working in front of a computer screen. The isolation and disconnection from the world prevented me maintaining focus when my head was in the abstract world of programming.

As a result of trying new hobbies that involved physical engagement I discovered the joy of woodworking.

A while into developing this hobby I happened to stumble across
a modded PC case online that was made with a mix of wood and aluminium. I loved the
look and further searching online made me realise that there was in fact no way that
someone could buy a case like this.

So naturally I saw an opportunity for a business that would sell these types of cases and one I would love to set up as it married my interest with technology with my new interest in woodwork.

Early sharing of a prototype online picked up a lot of traction after the case manufacturer
NZXT shared it on all their socials receiving over 20,000 likes and hundreds of positive
comments far exceeding NZXT's average post engagement of just a couple thousand likes.

This gave me the confidence to invest more time and money into setting something up for real.

At this time I have completed my first case design which is now available for purchase in three different timbers at [www.woodfortcases.com](https://www.woodfortcases.com). However whilst set up, I lack the money to properly market it so the business sits largely shelved for the time being.
