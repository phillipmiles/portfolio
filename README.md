## To keep in mind
### Routers
Once React Router v6 is released (sometime early 2020) I'll need to migrate over to it from Reach Router. According to the devs the APIs  between Reach and React Router v6 should be pretty similar. More similar then from React Router v5 which is why I've gone with Reach Router. See https://reacttraining.com/blog/reach-react-router-future/ for more info.
